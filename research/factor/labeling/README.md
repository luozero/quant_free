## Labeling

### Motivation

In Chapter 2, we explored how to construct a financial feature matrix \( X \) from unstructured datasets. Unsupervised learning algorithms can learn patterns from the feature matrix \( X \), such as identifying information related to hierarchical clusters.

In contrast, supervised learning algorithms are designed to associate the rows of the feature matrix \( X \) with a label array or values \( y \), allowing them to predict these labels or values based on the characteristics of the samples.

Chapter 3 will discuss methods for labeling using financial data.
